Uses Bresenham's line algorithm to prevent gaps in drawing. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham's_line_algorithm for more information and an interesting read. Admittedly this algorithm is a bit slower than usual because JavaScript does not support integer math (obviously ignoring big integers).
